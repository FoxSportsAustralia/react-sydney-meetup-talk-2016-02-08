            An invariant has been violated. To the dictionary!
            * So something changed which shouldn't have. Because....
            * One of the core features of react is the virtual DOM and DOM diffing. This relies on React having exclusive control of its elements
            * DOM elements mutates without React = react freaks out
            * BUT this isn't always possible, for example when using other javascript libraries which need access to the DOM

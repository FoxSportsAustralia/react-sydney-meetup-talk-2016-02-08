# Agenda #

## Complex Business logic
### Keeping View Clean
* Bacon JS / functional programming

## Reusable Components
### Shared Repos
* React JS 13 -> 14
** Can't share components
** Can 13/14 be on the same page provided don't touch each other

## View Composition
* Component within a Component
** Standard Parent -> Child hierarchy
** Compose view outside of React (Props of Views)
